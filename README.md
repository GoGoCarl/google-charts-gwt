Google Charts for GWT (Deprecated)

Google Charts Image API is a useful chart API that provides lightweight 
charts for web and mobile applications.  No javascript/flash/CSS tricks 
required, just an image on a page driven by a URL.

Google Charts API for Image Charts is now deprecated, but there are 
no plans to turn off support as per Google's own documentation, so 
leaving this here in case it is still useful and supported.
